**Voices of Amerikua** is a collaborative multimedia project and online platform dedicated to promoting efforts to protect the culture and rights of indigenous peoples and Mother Nature throughout North, Central and South America.

**Voices of Amerikua** seeks to partner with filmmakers, media producers, activists, musicians and the indigenous communities themselves to create and share original media pieces that share the stories of these communities standing on the front lines of protecting our environment and their traditional cultures and ways of life.

**Voices of Amerikua** was born out of the necessity to share and support the struggles of indigenous communities in North, Central and South America, which together speak more than 300 hundred languages.

Our mission is to edit, translate and produce original media in partnership specifically with Indigenous Nations, Leaders, Youth and Wisdom Keepers of North, Central and South America.We would like to help bring digital media tools to some of these communities to empower them to create their own original pieces so the original **Voices of Amerikua** can be heard by the entire world.
