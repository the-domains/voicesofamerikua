# About

**Voices of Amerikua** is a collaborative multimedia project and online platform dedicated to promoting efforts to protect the culture and rights of indigenous peoples and Mother Nature throughout North, Central and South America.

The term 'Amerikua' obtains its origin from the Mayan language of the Yucatan Peninsula, a term used for the continent America, which refers to "The Land of the Four Winds". It is another term for what some First Nation communities have called 'Turtle Island', and what the Kuna tribe of Panama call 'Abya Ayala'.
